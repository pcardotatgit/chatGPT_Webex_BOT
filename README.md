# chatGPT Webex BOT ( Under Development )

This project is a basic chatGPT webex bot that allows users to interact with chatGPT thru a webex room

It is given as a proof of concept, as a code template that has the goal to make you understand how to build it.

You will see that it doesn't depend on the openai python module, but use raw APIs. Which helps to better understand what we do at the basic level.

Stay tuned... the code is ready to be published
